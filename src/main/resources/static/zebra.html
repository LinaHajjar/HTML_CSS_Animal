  The zebra
  any of three species of strikingly black-and-white striped mammals of the horse family Equidae (genus Equus):
  the plains zebra (E. quagga),
  which is found in rich grasslands over much of eastern and southern Africa;
  Grevy’s zebra (E. grevyi), which lives in arid, sparsely wooded areas in Kenya and a few small areas in Ethiopia;
  and the mountain zebra (E. zebra),
  which inhabits dry upland plains in Namibia and a few scattered areas in western South Africa.
  The plains zebra is made up of six subspecies:
  E. quagga crawshaii (Crawshay’s zebra),
  E. quagga borensis (half-maned zebra),
  E. quagga boehmi (Grant’s zebra),
  E. quagga chapmani (Chapman’s zebra),
  E. quagga burchellii (Burchell’s zebra),
  and E. quagga quagga (quagga, which is extinct).
  The mountain zebra is made up of two subspecies: E. zebra hartmannae (Hartmann’s mountain zebra) and E. zebra zebra (Cape Mountain zebra).
